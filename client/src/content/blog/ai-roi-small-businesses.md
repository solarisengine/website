## Cost-Benefit Analysis Framework

### Calculating Your ROI

**Step 1: Identify Current Costs**

```
Labor Costs = Hours per week × Hourly rate × 52 weeks
Example: 10 hours/week × $25/hour × 52 = $13,000/year
```

**Step 2: Calculate Automation Savings**

```
Time Savings = Current time × Efficiency improvement
Cost Savings = Time savings × Hourly rate
Example: 10 hours × 60% efficiency × $25 = $150/week = $7,800/year
```

**Step 3: Factor in Implementation Costs**

```
Total Investment = Setup costs + Monthly fees × 12 months
Example: $2,000 + ($300 × 12) = $5,600/year
```

**Step 4: Calculate ROI**

```
ROI = (Annual Savings - Annual Investment) / Annual Investment × 100
Example: ($7,800 - $5,600) / $5,600 × 100 = 39% ROI
```
